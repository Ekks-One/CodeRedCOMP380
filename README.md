üü¶Demo Description

This video showcases the core functionality and system architecture. The demonstration focuses on the Universal Cart System, which Xavier designed and implemented using the Singleton design pattern to ensure only one cart instance exists, preventing state inconsistency and guaranteeing a trustworthy checkout flow.

The demo also runs through the full operational procedure, including product searching, dynamic item viewing (with color/size options), and order finalization with automated email confirmation.

Our product list is dynamic variant handled (where the availability of one option, like material, is conditional on the selection of another, like size or color), and order finalization with automated email confirmation.

This showcases our team's ability to model complex, real-world retail constraints within a relational database and presetn the data dynamically in the user interface.
